1. 

Evidence looks ok.

Good organization of screenshots.


2.

Minimum knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey. Please
review this concepts for the mid-term and final.

The distinction between a superkey and candidate key is deficient. Remember
that a candidate key is the minimum set of superkeys. 


3.

Perhaps email could be nullable? There might be some (old?) human beings that
have no email addresses.


4.

There are some typos in the responses. E.g., ``... in order if a ...''.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with redundancy. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.
