Correct output for all queries
Correct queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here



In general: 

- You must indent your queries to improve readability!

- PLEASE only include your queries! You an additional query that was not
  required. 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Very good!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
